*\n   * ### 简介\n   *\n   * ActionSheet是一个从底部弹出的按钮表单，一般都是由很多Button组成。当用户点击确认完毕后关闭. 可以把它当做**确认单组件**, 或者**单选组件**, 但是按钮建议不超过6个, 如果超过了组件也能正确处理, 比如滚动选择.\n   *\n   *\n   * ### 关于buttons属性\n   * - role属性: 可以是cancel(关闭)/destructive(警告/删除)/null, destructive在IOS下有用, 样式为红色字体\n   * - icon属性: 具体参考Icon组件的写法\n   *\n   * ### 注意点\n   *\n   * - 组件挂载点在App组件中定义, 是在业务页面之上, 且开启loading/toast都不会遮盖他.\n   * - 弹出层默认都是根据路由相应的, 当路由切换则弹层自动关闭, 这部分可用`dismissOnPageChange`修改.\n   * - 可以点击背景关闭组件, 这个在`enableBackdropDismiss`中定义.\n   * - 建议在关闭动画Promise之后处理请他业务, 这样动画会顺滑一些, 这里监听动画的关闭不是使用setTimeout, 而是监听transitionEnd事件, 因此更可靠.\n   *\n   * @props {String} [title]                        - ActionSheet的标题\n   * @props {string} [subTitle]                     - ActionSheet的副标题\n   * @props {string} [cssClass]                     - Additional classes for custom styles, separated by spaces\n   * @props {Boolean} [enableBackdropDismiss=true]  - 允许点击backdrop关闭actionsheet\n   * @props {Boolean} [dismissOnPageChange=true]    - 路由切换关闭组件\n   * @props {string} [mode=ios]                     - 样式模式\n   * @props {Array} [buttons]                       - button数组，包含全部role\n   * @props {Array} buttons.text                       - button显示文本\n   * @props {Array} buttons.icon                       - button显示的icon的name, 具体参考Icon组件\n   * @props {Array} buttons.role                       - 可以是cancel(关闭)/destructive(警告/删除)/null\n   * @props {Array} buttons.handler                    - 默认是关闭组件\n   * @props {Array} buttons.cssClass                   - 自定义样式\n   *\n   * @demo https://dtfe.github.io/vimo-demo/#/action-sheet\n   *

@component Alert\n   * @description\n   *\n   * ## 对话框 / Alert对话框组件\n   *\n   * 对话框作为和用户交互的弹出层组件, 向用户提供操作选择或操作列表, 让使用者作出决定。 这里的对话框可以是: Alert/Confirm/Radios/Checkboxes/Input等.\n   *\n   * 这里需要注意的是, Select组件使用的就是Radio/Checkboxes这两模式的封装, 但是单选多选两者只能选一个模式出现. 另外, 对于Input类文本输入, 可以混合使用, 比如url，email，text等，如果确认表单过多, 请单独开一页或者用modal组件处理.\n   *\n   *\n   * ### 关于buttons属性的说明\n   * - role属性: cancel只在ios下有用, 他会将标记cancel的button做特殊处理, 比如点击背景关闭则触发cancel的handler\n   * - cssClass属性: 这个属性用于自定义button的样式, 同理, 外层的cssClass用来定义整个弹层的样式\n   * - handler属性: 默认是关闭当前的组件, 可以通过`this.$alert.dismiss()`返回的Promise做后续处理, 他表示整个动画完毕\n   *\n   * ### 关于inputs属性的说明\n   * - inputs属性内type的属性的填值能改变弹出层的展现形式, 比如: input/checkbox/radio等三种形式\n   * - 上述的三种形式一次只能选择一种, 这个是规定定死的.\n   * - 关于input的type类型: text/tel/number/email -> 对应的其余属性可以是: type/name/placeholder/value\n   * - 关于input的type类型: checkbox/radio -> 对应的其余属性可以是: type/value/label/checked/disabled\n   * - 如果混用达不到效果, 这个是我们的约定\n   *\n   *\n   * ### 使用注意\n   *\n   * - 建议在关闭弹出层动画后在处理关闭事项, 比如跳转/再次弹出提示等\n   * - 弹层组件全部对路由跳转相应, 比如路由切换则弹层自动关闭, 这个可以通过`dismissOnPageChange`设置\n   * - button超过三个则纵向排列\n   * - 更详细的示例请看demo\n   *\n   *\n   * @props {String} title              -

list有多重种风格的样式，有ios/android等等,对应ios/md模式.\n   *\n   *\n   * ### 拓展\n   * 此外, List组件也是`radioGroup`的管理域. 因为单选的确定需要一个父集. radio的使用需要开启`radioGroup`. 同时, v-model/事件等才能正常运行. 因为, List组件是radio-group的受体, 当点击radio时, radio向外寻找到这里, 传递v-model信息.\n   *\n   * radio对外事件: onChange\n   *\n   * ### item-sliding功能\n   * 支持item-sliding（**此功能已开发完毕，但还需修改, 暂时不建议使用**）\n   *\n\n   *\n   * ### 如何使用\n   *\n   * ```\n

* @description\n   *\n   * ## 弹出层 / Loading组件(大Loading)\n   *\n   * Loading也有大小之分\n   *\n   * ### 关于大小Loading的问题\n   *\n   * Loading的使用场景是这样的: 当用户访问数据/资源加载/需要等待操作的需求下使用, 完整的情况下需要向用户说明我这次Loading是做什么, 比如Loading是提示\"**正在请求资源, 请稍后!**\", 有时我们并不需提示, 只需要显示菊花图即可, 因为频繁的显示大Loading还是很烦的, 这里需要介绍下Indicator组件, 他是继承Loading组件, 但是只显示菊花图, 而且调用也简单, 不必每次传入参数.\n   *\n   * ### 弹出层\n   *\n   * - Loading通过present开启, 如果没设置duration, 则需要手动dismiss,\n   * - Vimo的弹出层都是独立于页面的, 但也不是`body`的直接子元素, 而是挂载在App组件中的. 这样做是有考量的.\n   * - 组件相应路由切换, 路由切换则自动关闭\n   *\n   * ### 用法\n   *\n   * - 不传参数则显示菊花\n   * - 传入string则显示string\n   * - 参考下面的示例\n   *\n   *\n   * @props {string} [spinner='ios'] - 菊花样式\n   * @props {string} [content] - 内容\n   * @props {string} [cssClass] - 自定义样式\n   * @props {boolean} [showBackdrop=false] - 是否显示黑色背景\n   * @props {number} [duration=5000] - loading持续时间, 如果为0则无效, 默认提供5000ms持续时间\n   * @props {boolean} [dismissOnPageChange=true] - 页面切换是否关闭loading\n   * @props {string} [mode='ios'] - 模式\n   *\n   * @demo https://dtfe.github.io/vimo-demo/#/loading\n   * @see component:Indicator\n   * @usage\n   *\n   * // 只显示菊花\n   * spinnerOnly () {\n   *      this.$loading.present();\n   *

只是导航条多了后退按钮, 且在当前业务页面中, **Navbar有且必须只有一个**, 也只有这个组件中的Title组件才有控制`document.title`的能力.\n   *\n   * Navbar一般是放在Header组件中使用, 并且在Navbar组件中经常和Title组件组合使用.\n   *\n   * 因为Navbar和Toolbar很相似, 其位置属性完全一样. 包括: **start/end/left/end**\n   *\n   * ### 后退按钮显示时机\n   * 因为Vimo内建导航历史记录, 当历史记录中有上一条历史时显示后退按钮,反之, 不显示后退按钮. 当然也可以通过`hideBackButton`属性控制\n   *\n   * ### 点击后退\n   *\n   * 点击后退执行的是 `window.history.back()` 方法, 这个和点击后退按钮的效果是一样的.\n   *\n   * ### 如何引入\n   *\n   * ```\n   * // 引入\n   * import { Navbar } from 'vimo/components/navbar'\n   * // 安装\n   * Vue.component(Navbar.name, Navbar)\n   * ```\n   *\n   * ### 如果在支付宝中\n   *\n   * 如果在支付宝中, 对Navbar右侧设置按钮就能同步设置到支付宝的顶部导航栏而不需要其他操作. 路由切换后支付宝导航条也切换状态. 前提是必须在每页设置Navbar组件.\n   *\n   * 因为支付宝中的iconType在H5中并没有一一对应的iconName(目前使用的是ionicon图标库), 因此, 对于支付宝默认支持的icon, 这里有一一对应的关系, 即在H5中的ICON组件中设置了左侧的这些名称, 在支付宝中就像是右侧的typeName\n   *\n   * H5命名               | 支付宝命名\n   * ---------------------|-------------\n   * 'person'             | 'user',\n   * 'glasses'            | 'filter',\n   * 'search'             | 'search',\n   * 'add'                | 'add',\n   * 'settings'           | 'settings',\n   * 'qr-scanner'         | 'scan',\n   * 'information-circle' | 'info',\n   * 'help'               | 'help',\n   * 'pin'                | 'locate',\n   * 'more'               | 'more'\n   *\n   * 正确设置导航条参考请参考下面代码, 强烈建议按钮设置不超过两个\n   *\n   * ```\n   * <Buttons right slot=\"buttons\">\n   *     <Button @click=\"$menus.open('menu')\" role=\"bar-button\">\n   *          WITH OUT SPAN\n   *     </Button>\n   *     <Button @click=\"$menus.open('menu')\" role=\"bar-button\">\n   *          <span>WITH SPAN</span>\n   *     </Button>\n   *     <Button @click=\"$menus.open('menu')\" color=\"dark\" role=\"bar-button\">\n   *          <Icon name=\"icon-vue\"></Icon>\n   *          <Badge>0</Badge>\n   *     </Button>\n   *     <Button @click=\"$menus.open('menu')\" color=\"dark\" role=\"bar-button\">\n   *          <Icon name=\"qr-scanner\"></Icon>\n   *          <Badge>12</Badge>\n   *     </Button>\n   * </Buttons>\n   * ```\n   *\n   * 并不是所有的Alipya的JSSDK都有H5对应的方法, 因为有些JSSDK不常用或者H5无法实现或者即使实现在业务中使用还不是单独设置简便, 因此Vimo目前实现的功能如下:\n   *\n   * - 在Navbar组件中Title组件能同步更新WebView中的Title\n   * - 在Navbar组件中的背景色(backgroundColor, 前提是使用: primary, secondary, danger, light, dark 设置的颜色)能同步更新到WebView中, 如果页面切换则重置设置.\n   * - 对Navbar组件调用showPopMenu方法, 可在右侧显示popover组件, 如果实在WebView中, 则使用原生方法(Alipay), PS: 因为是弹出层组件, 所以是方法调用开启.\n   * - 监听Title组件的'onTitleClick'事件, 可以监听点击Title文本的事件, 如果是在WebView中, 则触发原生事件, 页面将不干扰\n   *\n   *\n   * ### 注意点\n   *\n   * ** 不建议在keepAlive模式使用  **\n   *\n   *\n   * 因为Navbar组件在此模式下只执行最后一个页面的Navbar更新, 如果页面已经打开过, 则会导致样式状态问题. 解决办法是在`activated`钩子中执行Navbar组件的`initWhenInWebview`方法, 这个是内部方法, 表示重新初始化Navbar组件.\n   *\n   * @see component:Toolbar\n   * @see History\n   *\n   * @props {String} [mode=ios] - 模式\n   * @props {String} [color] - 颜色\n   * @props {Boolean} [hideBackButton=false] -

比如选择水果的话不能类别和新鲜度同时选择. 因此, 如果期望能进行城市三级选择, Picker能够解决这个需求, 详情参考Demo.\n   *\n   * ### 传参说明\n   *\n   * 因为Picker组件为了满足大多数的需求, 且能根据业务定制化, 比如被Datetime组件/CitySelect业务定制等. 因此Picker传参有点点麻烦. 主要参数如下:\n   *\n   *\n   * #### 1. buttons属性\n   *\n   名称 / Name | 类型 / Type | 描述 / Description\n   ----------|-----------|--------------------------------\n   text      | string    | 显示的文本\n   role      | string    | 按钮的角色, 取消按钮的role为cancel, 其他的没有\n   handler   | function  | 点击按钮的处理方法\n   *\n   * #### 2. columns属性\n   *\n   名称 / Name     | 类型 / Type          | 描述 / Description\n   --------------|--------------------|---------------------------\n   name          | string             | 这个column的名称\n   align         | string             | column对齐方式\n   selectedIndex | number             | 当前column的初始选的位置(index)\n   prefix        | string             | 这一列显示的前缀\n   prefixWidth   | string             | 前缀固定宽度, 例如'50px'\n   suffix        | string             | 这一列显示的后缀\n   suffixWidth   | string             | 后缀固定宽度, 例如'50px'\n   cssClass      | string             | 当前column的自定义样式, 使用空格分割多个值\n   columnWidth   | string             | 每个column的最大宽度, 默认宽度均分\n   optionsWidth  | string             | 每个column中的选项最大宽度\n   options       | PickerColumnOption | 当前column的每个选项列表\n   *\n   *\n   * #### 3. columns属性中的options属性\n   *\n   名称 / Name | 类型 / Type | 描述 / Description\n   ----------|-----------|------------------\n   text      | string    | 显示的文本\n   value     | *         | 对显示文本的值\n   disabled  | boolean   | 是否禁用\n   *\n   *\n   * #### 4. onChange钩子\n   *\n   * 当用户选定后触发钩子, 传递的数据包括三列的详细选择信息.\n   *\n   * #### 5. onSelect钩子\n   *\n   * 某一列选择之后触发, 包含单列的选择信息\n   *\n   * ### 组件自动支持切换alipay组件\n   *\n   * 如果强制使用H5模式需要在开启options中传入`isH5=true`, alipay组件只支持最多两级且不可联动.\n   *\n   * ### 如何使用\n   *\n   * 因为是弹出层组件, 故引入后, `Picker.present(...)`就可打开组件\n   *\n   * ```\n   *  import { Picker } from 'vimo/components/picker'\n   * ```\n   *\n   * @demo

组件支持异步操作实例化\n   * - 目前组件的层级嵌套关系如下:  List -> Item -> Radio\n   * - 动态设置了单个radio的禁用状态, 如果之前是选中的则取消选中, 手动点击和数据选中都会生效\n   *\n   * ### 组件通讯关系\n   *\n   * 1. 初始化时, radio组件自己的this传递给radio-group, recordRadio()\n   * 2. Radio点击时, 调用List组件的onRadioChange函数, 传递自己的value\n   * 3. List组件得到value触发input更新v-modal值, 之后遍历子组件Radio, 触发组件的setChecked, 传递value\n   * 4. 子组件根据传入的value设置自己的状态\n   *\n   *\n   * ### 如何引入\n   * ```\n   * // 引入\n   * import { Radio } from 'vimo/components/radio'\n   * // 安装\n   * Vue.component(Radio.name, Radio)\n   * // 或者\n   * export default{\n   *   components: {\n   *    Radio\n   *  }\n   * }\n   * ```\n   *\n   * @props {String} [mode='ios'] - 模式\n   * @props {String} [color] - 颜色\n   * @props {Boolean} [disabled=false] - 单向选择, 点击且换并不对父组件传递\n   *\n   * @fire component:Radio#onSelect - 点按选择时触发\n   * @demo https://dtfe.github.io/vimo-demo/#/radio\n   * @usage\n   * <List radio-group v-model=\"fruits\" :disabled=\"isListDisabled\">\n   *    <ListHeader>Fruits</ListHeader>\n   *    <Item>\n   *        <Label>Apple</Label>\n   *        <Radio value=\"apple\" :disabled=\"isAppleDisabled\" @onSelect=\"onSelectHandler\"></Radio>\n   *    </Item>\n   *    <Item>\n   *        <Label>Banana</Label>\n   *        <Radio value=\"banana\" color=\"danger\" @onSelect=\"onSelectHandler\"></Radio>\n   *    </Item>\n   *    <Item>\n   *        <Label>Cherry (secondary color)</Label>\n   *        <Radio value=\"cherry\" color=\"secondary\" @onSelect=\"onSelectHandler\"></Radio>\n   *    </Item>\n   *    <Item>\n   *         <Label>Disabled</Label>\n   *        <Radio value=\"disabled\" :disabled=\"true\" @onSelect=\"onSelectHandler\"></Radio>\n   *    </Item>\n   *    <Item>\n   *        <Label>Default</Label>\n   *        <Radio value=\"default\" @onSelect=\"onSelectHandler\"></Radio>\n   *    </Item>\n   * </List>\n   *\n   * */\n  import { setElementClass, isTrueProperty } from '../../util/util'\n  let id = 0\n  export default{\n    name: 'Radio',\n    data () {\n      return {\n        isChecked: false,               // 内部 选中\n        isDisabled: this.disabled,      // 内部 禁用\n        itemComponent: null,            // item组件实例\n        radioGroupComponent: null,      // list(radioGroup)组件实例\n        isInit: false,                  // 初始化状态\n        id: `rb-${id++}`               // id\n      }\n    },\n    props: {\n      // 固定值\n      value: [String],\n      disabled: [Boolean],\n      color: [String],\n      mode: {\n        type: String,\n        default () { return this.$config && this.$config.get('mode') || 'ios' }\n      }\n    },\n    watch: {\n      disabled (val) {\n        this.setDisabled(isTrueProperty(val))\n      }\n    },\n    computed: {\n      modeClass () {\n        return `radio radio-${this.mode}`\n      },\n      colorClass () {\n        return this.color ?

**App平台级别**的初始化类\n *\n *\n * ## 说明\n *\n * 这个类用于从设备中获取平台信息, 比如设备种类/运行平台/设备方向/文字方向等, 以此使得代码适配所有机型. 此外, 还支持平台方法的注册, 使业务与平台解耦.\n *\n *\n *\n * ## 注册及执行平台的方法 registerMethod/do\n *\n * 这部分是Vimo框架的核心, 其把业务代码无平台代码进行解耦, 保持在业务逻辑中不处理平台相关的操作, 让Vimo能够运行在多平台而不改动代码.\n *\n * **业务使用的方法应该由当前的平台提供**\n *\n * 平台在初始化完毕时, 执行`src/config/platform-configs.js`定义的`onBridgeReady`钩子, 通过在传入`plt`实例上, 执行`registerMethod`方法注册当前平台对应的方法.\n *   例如微信JSSDK中的`chooseImg`和`scanCode`方法(其他平台同理):\n *\n * ```\n * onBridgeReady(plt){\n *  // this.$platform.do('chooseImage',function (result) {})\n *  plt.registerMethod('chooseImage', function (callback) {\n *    wx.chooseImage({\n *      count: 1, // 默认9\n *      sizeType: ['original', 'compressed'], // 可以指定是原图还是压缩图，默认二者都有\n *      sourceType: ['album', 'camera'], // 可以指定来源是相册还是相机，默认二者都有\n *      success: function (res) {\n *        // alert('res')\n *        // alert(JSON.stringify(res))\n *        var localIds = res.localIds // 返回选定照片的本地ID列表，localId可以作为img标签的src属性显示图片\n *        callback && callback(localIds)\n *      }\n *    })\n *  })\n *\n *  // this.$platform.do('scanCode',function(result){})\n *  plt.registerMethod('scanCode', function (callback) {\n *    wx.scanQRCode({\n *      needResult: 1, // 扫描结果由微信处理，1则直接返回扫描结果，\n *      scanType: ['barCode', 'qrCode'], // 可以指定扫二维码还是一维码，默认二者都有\n *      success: function (res) {\n *        callback && callback(res.resultStr.toString())\n *      }\n *    })\n *  })\n * }\n *```\n *\n * 业务这样使用即可达到完全解耦:\n *\n * ```\n * this.$platform.do('chooseImg', function(result){....})\n * ```\n *\n *\n *\n */\n\n/**\n * 结构体定义\n *\n * @typedef {Object} PlatformConfig\n * {\n *    isEngine?: boolean;\n *    initialize?: Function;\n *    isMatch?: Function;\n *

     this.$modal.present({\n *          mode: 'zoom',\n *          component: modalPageComponent,\n *          data: {hello: 'Page1Data'},\n *          showBackdrop: true,\n *

It is\n     * complicated, thus this doc is long and (hopefully) detailed enough to answer\n     * your questions.\n     *\n     * If you need to react to the mouse wheel in a predictable way, this code is\n     * like your bestest friend. * hugs *\n     *\n     * As of today, there are 4 DOM event types you can listen to:\n     *\n     *   'wheel'                -- Chrome(31+), FF(17+), IE(9+)\n     *   'mousewheel'           -- Chrome, IE(6+), Opera, Safari\n     *   'MozMousePixelScroll'  -- FF(3.5 only!) (2010-2013) -- don't bother!\n     *   'DOMMouseScroll'       -- FF(0.9.7+) since 2003\n     *\n     * So what to do?  The is the best:\n     *\n     *   normalizeWheel.getEventType();\n     *\n     * In your event callback, use this code to get sane interpretation of the\n     * deltas.  This code will return an object with properties:\n     *\n     *   spinX   -- normalized spin speed (use for zoom) - x plane\n     *   spinY   -- \" - y plane\n     *   pixelX  -- normalized distance (to pixels) - x plane\n     *   pixelY  -- \" - y plane\n     *\n     * Wheel values are provided by the browser assuming you are using the wheel to\n     * scroll a web page by a number of lines or pixels (or pages).  Values can vary\n     * significantly on different platforms and browsers, forgetting that you can\n     * scroll at different speeds.  Some devices (like trackpads) emit more events\n     * at smaller increments with fine granularity, and some emit massive jumps with\n     * linear speed or acceleration.\n     *\n     * This code does its best to normalize the deltas for you:\n     *\n     *   - spin is trying to normalize how far the wheel was spun (or trackpad\n     *     dragged).  This is super useful for zoom support where you want to\n     *     throw away the chunky scroll steps on the PC and make those equal to\n     *     the slow and smooth tiny steps on the Mac. Key data: This code tries to\n     *     resolve a single slow step on a wheel to 1.\n     *\n     *   - pixel is normalizing the desired scroll delta in pixel units.  You'll\n     *     get the crazy differences between browsers, but at least it'll be in\n     *     pixels!\n     *\n     *   - positive value indicates scrolling DOWN/RIGHT, negative UP/LEFT.  This\n     *     should translate to positive value zooming IN, negative zooming OUT.\n     *     This matches the newer 'wheel' event.\n     *\n     * Why are there spinX, spinY (or pixels)?\n     *\n     *   - spinX is a 2-finger side drag on the trackpad, and a shift + wheel turn\n     *     with a mouse.  It results in side-scrolling in the browser by default.\n     *\n     *   - spinY is what you expect -- it's the classic axis of a mouse wheel.\n     *\n     *   - I dropped spinZ/pixelZ.  It is supported by the DOM 3 'wheel' event and\n     *     probably is by browsers in conjunction with fancy 3D controllers .. but\n     *     you know.\n     *\n     * Implementation info:\n     *\n     * Examples of 'wheel' event if you scroll slowly (down) by one step with an\n     * average mouse:\n     *\n     *   OS X + Chrome  (mouse)     -    4   pixel delta  (wheelDelta -120)\n     *   OS X + Safari  (mouse)     -  N/A   pixel delta  (wheelDelta  -12)\n     *   OS X + Firefox (mouse)     -    0.1 line  delta  (wheelDelta  N/A)\n     *   Win8 + Chrome  (mouse)     -  100   pixel delta  (wheelDelta -120)\n     *   Win8 + Firefox (mouse)     -    3   line  delta  (wheelDelta -120)\n     *\n     * On the trackpad:\n     *\n     *   OS X + Chrome  (trackpad)  -    2   pixel delta  (wheelDelta   -6)\n     *   OS X + Firefox (trackpad)  -    1   pixel delta  (wheelDelta  N/A)\n     *\n     * On other/older browsers.. it's more complicated as there can be multiple and\n     * also missing delta values.\n     *\n     * The 'wheel' event is more standard:\n     *\n     * http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#events-wheelevents\n     *\n     * The basics is that it includes a unit, deltaMode (pixels, lines, pages), and\n     * deltaX, deltaY and deltaZ.  Some browsers provide other values to maintain\n     * backward compatibility with older events.  Those other values help us\n     * better normalize spin speed.
