 参数\n * @property {boolean=false} options.needLogPage  - 是否为开启日志界面, 如果为false, 则需要手动`this.$log.init()`\n *\n *\n * ## 关于console截断\n *\n * log服务会截断console, 并且将console传入参数进行搜集并显示, 故在开发中, console的触发位置将会在插件内, 这点需要注意!\n *\n *\n * ## 关于全局错误兜底\n *\n * 是的, 插件在内部对`window.onerror`和`window.addEventListener('error', function (err) {})`进行兜底, 不过还是建议在可能出错的地方进行try/catch处理.\n *\n *\n * ## try/catch的err序列化处理\n *\n * 一般来说, 返回的err是原始数据, 这里需要对这个err兼容处理, 以便其返回的api能与插件处理的api吻合, 这个比较简单, 插件已考虑到这个问题, 写法如下: 用console.error(err)就行了.\n *\n * ```\n * try {\n *    window.decodeURI('%2')\n * } catch (err) {\n *    console.error(err)\n * }\n * ```\n *\n *\n * ## 安装\n *\n * ```\n * import log from './log'\n * Vue.use(log, {\n *  needLogPage: false, // 初始化是否显示log页面\n * })\n * ```\n *\n * ## 方法\n *\n * ### 1. 初始化log界面\n *\n *```\n * this.$log.init() // 初始化界面\n *```\n *\n * ### 2. 显示隐藏log界面\n *\n *```\n * this.$log.open()\n * this.$log.close()\n *```\n *\n * ### 3. 可用方法\n *\n *```\n * console.log(string)\n * this.$log.log(string)\n *\n * console.debug(string)\n * this.$log.debug(string)\n *\n * console.info(string)\n * this.$log.info(string)\n *\n * console.warn(any) // 警告, 但是不影响运行\n * this.$log.warn(any)\n *\n * console.error(any)  // 错误, 可能终止运行\n * this.$log.error(any)\n *\n * console.assert(boolean, any) // 断言, 如果为false则报错, 不同于error\n * this.$log.assert(boolean,any)\n *```\n *\n * ## error/warn/assert中的any类型\n *\n * 1. 可以是error对象, 比如try/catch返回的err\n * 2. 可以是string, 普通显示\n * 3. 复杂点的string序列: message, errorName, script, line, 例如\n *\n * ```\n * console.error('未得到ajax的数据','AJAX TIMEOUT/FAIL','./getData.js::<Function>getInfo()','12')\n * console.assert(false, '断言错误, 这个值必须是String','AJAX ASSERT','./getData.js::<Function>getInfo()','12')\n * ```\n *\n * ### 4. 获取全部错误记录\n *\n * ```\n * this.$log.getHistory\n * ```\n *\n *\n *\n *\n */\nconst HAS_CONSOLE = typeof window.console !== 'undefined'\n\nexport default{\n  /**\n   * @param {object} Vue -

*\n   * ### 简介\n   *\n   * ActionSheet是一个从底部弹出的按钮表单，一般都是由很多Button组成。当用户点击确认完毕后关闭. 可以把它当做**确认单组件**, 或者**单选组件**, 但是按钮建议不超过6个, 如果超过了组件也能正确处理, 比如滚动选择.\n   *\n   *\n   * ### 关于buttons属性\n   * - role属性: 可以是cancel(关闭)/destructive(警告/删除)/null, destructive在IOS下有用, 样式为红色字体\n   * - icon属性: 具体参考Icon组件的写法\n   *\n   * ### 注意点\n   *\n   * - 组件挂载点在App组件中定义, 是在业务页面之上, 且开启loading/toast都不会遮盖他.\n   * - 弹出层默认都是根据路由相应的, 当路由切换则弹层自动关闭, 这部分可用`dismissOnPageChange`修改.\n   * - 可以点击背景关闭组件, 这个在`enableBackdropDismiss`中定义.\n   * - 建议在关闭动画Promise之后处理请他业务, 这样动画会顺滑一些, 这里监听动画的关闭不是使用setTimeout, 而是监听transitionEnd事件, 因此更可靠.\n   *\n   * @props {String} [title]                        - ActionSheet的标题\n   * @props {string} [subTitle]                     - ActionSheet的副标题\n   * @props {string} [cssClass]                     - Additional classes for custom styles, separated by spaces\n   * @props {Boolean} [enableBackdropDismiss=true]  - 允许点击backdrop关闭actionsheet\n   * @props {Boolean} [dismissOnPageChange=true]    - 路由切换关闭组件\n   * @props {string} [mode=ios]                     - 样式模式\n   * @props {Array} [buttons]                       - button数组，包含全部role\n   * @props {Array} buttons.text                       - button显示文本\n   * @props {Array} buttons.icon                       - button显示的icon的name, 具体参考Icon组件\n   * @props {Array} buttons.role                       - 可以是cancel(关闭)/destructive(警告/删除)/null\n   * @props {Array} buttons.handler                    - 默认是关闭组件\n   * @props {Array} buttons.cssClass                   - 自定义样式\n   *\n   *\n   * @demo http://xiangsongtao.com/vimo/#/action-sheet\n   *

@component Alert\n   * @description\n   *\n   * ## 对话框 / Alert对话框组件\n   *\n   * 对话框作为和用户交互的弹出层组件, 向用户提供操作选择或操作列表, 让使用者作出决定。 这里的对话框可以是: Alert/Confirm/Radios/Checkboxes/Input等.\n   *\n   * 这里需要注意的是, Select组件使用的就是Radio/Checkboxes这两模式的封装, 但是单选多选两者只能选一个模式出现. 另外, 对于Input类文本输入, 可以混合使用, 比如url，email，text等，如果确认表单过多, 请单独开一页或者用modal组件处理.\n   *\n   *\n   * ### 关于buttons属性的说明\n   * - role属性: cancel只在ios下有用, 他会将标记cancel的button做特殊处理, 比如点击背景关闭则触发cancel的handler\n   * - cssClass属性: 这个属性用于自定义button的样式, 同理, 外层的cssClass用来定义整个弹层的样式\n   * - handler属性: 默认是关闭当前的组件, 可以通过`this.$alert.dismiss()`返回的Promise做后续处理, 他表示整个动画完毕\n   *\n   * ### 关于inputs属性的说明\n   * - inputs属性内type的属性的填值能改变弹出层的展现形式, 比如: input/checkbox/radio等三种形式\n   * - 上述的三种形式一次只能选择一种, 这个是规定定死的.\n   * - 关于input的type类型: text/tel/number/email -> 对应的其余属性可以是: type/name/placeholder/value\n   * - 关于input的type类型: checkbox/radio -> 对应的其余属性可以是: type/value/label/checked/disabled\n   * - 如果混用达不到效果, 这个是我们的约定\n   *\n   *\n   * ### 使用注意\n   *\n   * - 建议在关闭弹出层动画后在处理关闭事项, 比如跳转/再次弹出提示等\n   * - 弹层组件全部对路由跳转相应, 比如路由切换则弹层自动关闭, 这个可以通过`dismissOnPageChange`设置\n   * - button超过三个则纵向排列\n   * - 更详细的示例请看demo\n   *\n   *\n   * @props {String} title              -

list有多重种风格的样式，有ios/android等等,对应ios/md模式.\n   *\n   *\n   * ### 拓展\n   * 此外, List组件也是`radioGroup`的管理域. 因为单选的确定需要一个父集. radio的使用需要开启`radioGroup`. 同时, v-model/事件等才能正常运行. 因为, List组件是radio-group的受体, 当点击radio时, radio向外寻找到这里, 传递v-model信息.\n   *\n   * radio对外事件: onChange\n   *\n   * ### item-sliding功能\n   * 支持item-sliding（**此功能已开发完毕，但还需修改, 暂时不建议使用**）\n   *\n\n   *\n   * ### 如何使用\n   *\n   * ```\n

弹出层 / Loading组件(大Loading)\n   *\n   * Loading也有大小之分\n   *\n   * ### 关于大小Loading的问题\n   *\n   * Loading的使用场景是这样的: 当用户访问数据/资源加载/需要等待操作的需求下使用, 完整的情况下需要向用户说明我这次Loading是做什么, 比如Loading是提示\"**正在请求资源, 请稍后!**\", 有时我们并不需提示, 只需要显示菊花图即可, 因为频繁的显示大Loading还是很烦的, 这里需要介绍下Indicator组件, 他是继承Loading组件, 但是只显示菊花图, 而且调用也简单, 不必每次传入参数.\n   *\n   * ### 弹出层\n   *\n   * - Loading通过present开启, 如果没设置duration, 则需要手动dismiss,\n   * - Vimo的弹出层都是独立于页面的, 但也不是`body`的直接子元素, 而是挂载在App组件中的. 这样做是有考量的.\n   * - 组件相应路由切换, 路由切换则自动关闭\n   *\n   * ### 用法\n   *\n   * - 不传参数则显示菊花\n   * - 传入string则显示string\n   * - 参考下面的示例\n   *\n   *\n   * @props {string} [spinner='ios'] - 菊花样式\n   * @props {string} [content] - 内容\n   * @props {string} [cssClass] - 自定义样式\n   * @props {boolean} [showBackdrop=false] - 是否显示黑色背景\n   * @props {number} [duration=5000] - loading持续时间, 如果为0则无效, 默认提供5000ms持续时间\n   * @props {boolean} [dismissOnPageChange=true] - 页面切换是否关闭loading\n   * @props {string} [mode='ios'] - 模式\n   *\n   * @demo http://xiangsongtao.com/vimo/#/loading\n   * @see component:Indicator\n   * @usage\n   *\n   * // 只显示菊花\n   * spinnerOnly () {\n   *      this.$loading.present();\n   *      setTimeout(() => {\n   *

     this.$loading.present('只传入了String');\n   *      setTimeout(() => {\n   *        this.$loading.dismiss().then(() => {\n   *          console.debug('dismiss in promise success!')\n   *        })\n

也只有这个组件中的Title组件才有控制`document.title`的能力.\n   *\n   * Navbar一般是放在Header组件中使用, 并且在Navbar组件中经常和Title组件组合使用.\n   *\n   * 因为Navbar和Toolbar很相似, 其位置属性完全一样. 包括: **start/end/left/end**\n   *\n   * ### 后退按钮显示时机\n   * 因为Vimo内建导航历史记录, 当历史记录中有上一条历史时显示后退按钮,反之, 不显示后退按钮. 当然也可以通过`hideBackButton`属性控制\n   *\n   * ### 点击后退\n   *\n   * 点击后退执行的是 `window.history.back()` 方法, 这个和点击后退按钮的效果是一样的.\n   *\n   * ### 如何引入\n   *\n   * ```\n   * // 引入\n   * import { Navbar } from 'vimo/components/navbar'\n   * // 安装\n   * Vue.component(Navbar.name, Navbar)\n   * ```\n   *\n   * @see component:Toolbar\n   * @see History\n   *\n   * @props {String} [mode=ios] - 模式\n   * @props {String} [color] - 颜色\n   * @props {Boolean} [hideBackButton=false] - 是否显示后退按钮\n   *\n   * @slot [空] 作为内容, 比如Title/Searchbar/Segment放置的位置\n   * @slot [buttons] 按钮组, 别忘记加[left]/[right]/[start]/[end]属性标记位置\n   *\n   * @usage\n   * <template>\n   *  <Page>\n   *    <Header>\n   *      <Navbar

Radio点击时, 调用List组件的onRadioChange函数, 传递自己的value\n   * 3. List组件得到value触发input更新v-modal值, 之后遍历子组件Radio, 触发组件的setChecked, 传递value\n   * 4. 子组件根据传入的value设置自己的状态\n   *\n   *\n   * ### 如何引入\n   * ```\n   * // 引入\n   * import { Radio } from 'vimo/components/radio'\n   * // 安装\n   * Vue.component(Radio.name, Radio)\n   * // 或者\n   * export default{\n   *   components: {\n   *    Radio\n   *  }\n   * }\n   * ```\n   *\n   * @props {String} [mode='ios'] - 模式\n   * @props {String} [color] - 颜色\n   * @props {Boolean} [disabled=false] - 单向选择, 点击且换并不对父组件传递\n   *\n   * @fire component:Radio#onSelect - 点按选择时触发\n   * @demo http://xiangsongtao.com/vimo/#/radio\n   * @usage\n   * <List radio-group v-model=\"fruits\" :disabled=\"isListDisabled\">\n   *    <ListHeader>Fruits</ListHeader>\n   *    <Item>\n   *        <Label>Apple</Label>\n   *        <Radio value=\"apple\" :disabled=\"isAppleDisabled\" @onSelect=\"onSelectHandler\"></Radio>\n   *    </Item>\n   *    <Item>\n   *        <Label>Banana</Label>\n   *        <Radio value=\"banana\" color=\"danger\" @onSelect=\"onSelectHandler\"></Radio>\n   *    </Item>\n   *    <Item>\n   *        <Label>Cherry (secondary color)</Label>\n   *        <Radio value=\"cherry\" color=\"secondary\" @onSelect=\"onSelectHandler\"></Radio>\n   *    </Item>\n   *    <Item>\n   *         <Label>Disabled</Label>\n   *        <Radio value=\"disabled\" :disabled=\"true\" @onSelect=\"onSelectHandler\"></Radio>\n   *    </Item>\n   *    <Item>\n   *        <Label>Default</Label>\n   *        <Radio value=\"default\" @onSelect=\"onSelectHandler\"></Radio>\n   *    </Item>\n   * </List>\n   *\n   * */\n  import { setElementClass, isTrueProperty } from '../../util/util'\n  let id = 0\n  export default{\n    name: 'Radio',\n    data () {\n      return {\n        isChecked: false,               // 内部 选中\n        isDisabled: this.disabled,      // 内部 禁用\n        itemComponent: null,            // item组件实例\n        radioGroupComponent: null,      // list(radioGroup)组件实例\n        isInit: false,                  // 初始化状态\n        id: `rb-${id++}`               // id\n      }\n    },\n    props: {\n      // 固定值\n      value: [String],\n      disabled: [Boolean],\n      color: [String],\n      mode: {\n        type: String,\n        default () { return this.$config.get('mode') || 'ios' }\n      }\n    },\n    watch: {\n      disabled (val) {\n        this.setDisabled(isTrueProperty(val))\n      }\n    },\n    computed: {\n      modeClass () {\n        return `radio radio-${this.mode}`\n      },\n      colorClass () {\n        return this.color ?

比如设备种类/运行平台/设备方向/文字方向等, 以此使得代码适配所有机型. 此外, 还支持平台方法的注册, 使业务与平台解耦.\n *\n *\n *\n * ## 注册及执行平台的方法 registerMethod/do\n *\n * 这部分是Vimo框架的核心, 其把业务代码无平台代码进行解耦, 保持在业务逻辑中不处理平台相关的操作, 让Vimo能够运行在多平台而不改动代码.\n *\n * **业务使用的方法应该由当前的平台提供**\n *\n * 平台在初始化完毕时, 执行`src/config/platform-configs.js`定义的`onBridgeReady`钩子, 通过在传入`plt`实例上, 执行`registerMethod`方法注册当前平台对应的方法.\n *   例如微信JSSDK中的`chooseImg`和`scanCode`方法(其他平台同理):\n *\n * ```\n * onBridgeReady(plt){\n *  // this.$platform.do('chooseImage',function (result) {})\n *  plt.registerMethod('chooseImage', function (callback) {\n *    wx.chooseImage({\n *      count: 1, // 默认9\n *      sizeType: ['original', 'compressed'], // 可以指定是原图还是压缩图，默认二者都有\n *      sourceType: ['album', 'camera'], // 可以指定来源是相册还是相机，默认二者都有\n *      success: function (res) {\n *        // alert('res')\n *        // alert(JSON.stringify(res))\n *        var localIds = res.localIds // 返回选定照片的本地ID列表，localId可以作为img标签的src属性显示图片\n *        callback && callback(localIds)\n *      }\n *    })\n *  })\n *\n *  // this.$platform.do('scanCode',function(result){})\n *  plt.registerMethod('scanCode', function (callback) {\n *    wx.scanQRCode({\n *      needResult: 1, // 扫描结果由微信处理，1则直接返回扫描结果，\n *      scanType: ['barCode', 'qrCode'], // 可以指定扫二维码还是一维码，默认二者都有\n *      success: function (res) {\n *        callback && callback(res.resultStr.toString())\n *      }\n *    })\n *  })\n * }\n *```\n *\n * 业务这样使用即可达到完全解耦:\n *\n * ```\n * this.$platform.do('chooseImg', function(result){....})\n * ```\n *\n *\n *\n */\n\n/**\n * 结构体定义\n *\n * @typedef {Object}
